Omegle vs Cleverbot
=========

Omegle vs Cleverbot is a simple ruby program that pipes output from an omegle conversation, to cleverbot, and back. It is the pinnacle of human scientific discovery, and coincidentally; my magnum opus.


Installation and usage
------------
I've only tested this on osx.

    git clone git://github.com/prettymuchbryce/omeglevscleverbot.git
    cd omeglevscleverbot
    bundle install
    ruby bot.rb
    
Thanks

Thanks to creators and maintainers of the romegle, and cleverbot-api gems. They did the hard work, I just hacked their work together.
