Omegle vs Cleverbot
=========

Omegle vs Cleverbot is a simple ruby program that pipes output from an omegle conversation, to cleverbot, and back. It is the pinnacle of human scientific discovery, and coincidentally; my magnum opus.


Installation and usage
------------
    git pull git://repohere
    cd cleverbotvsomegle
    bundle install
    ruby bot.rb

Thanks to creators and maintainers of the romegle, and cleverbot-api gems. They did the hard work, I just hacked them together.
